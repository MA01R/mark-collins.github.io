With over 15 years of experience, including extensive service in the U.S. military, I specialize in leading engineering teams, implementing secure infrastructure solutions, and driving innovation in tactical and strategic environments. I hold certifications in Cisco, CompTIA, and have extensive experience in both civilian and DoD communication systems.

Currently, I am completing a B.S. in Information Technology focused on cloud architecture and automation. This site serves as my digital portfolio to showcase projects and my professional journey.
